2. SSL certificate setup
3. Service configuration
4. Database initialization
5. Service startup and verification
6. Load balancer configuration
7. Monitoring setup
```

### 3. Troubleshooting Decision Tree
```markdown
# Troubleshooting Guide

## High Latency Issues (TTFT > 450ms)
```
Is the issue system-wide?
├─ YES → Check system resources (CPU, Memory, GPU)
│   ├─ High CPU → Scale translator workers
│   ├─ High Memory → Check for memory leaks
│   └─ High GPU → Optimize model batch sizes
└─ NO → Check specific service performance
    ├─ STT Service slow → Check model loading, GPU utilization
    ├─ MT Service slow → Check translation queue depth
    └─ TTS Service slow → Check voice model caching
```

## Caption Latency Issues (>250ms)
```
Are captions appearing at all?
├─ NO → Check STT service connectivity
│   └─ Service down → Restart STT service
└─ YES, but slow → Check LocalAgreement-2 configuration
    └─ Too conservative → Adjust stability threshold
```

## Audio Quality Issues
```
Is the issue with original audio or translated audio?
├─ Original → Check microphone settings, network quality
└─ Translated → Check TTS service, voice model quality
    └─ Robotic/Distorted → Check TTS synthesis parameters
```
```

### 4. Performance Optimization FAQ
```markdown
# Performance Optimization FAQ

## Latency Optimization

### Q: How can I reduce TTFT latency?
A: 
1. Co-locate SFU and translator workers
2. Use smaller STT models (tiny/base vs small/medium)
3. Optimize TTS vocoder lookahead settings
4. Reduce network hops between services
5. Use GPU acceleration for all ML models

### Q: What's the impact of different STT models?
A:
- whisper-tiny: ~50ms processing, lower accuracy
- whisper-base: ~100ms processing, balanced
- whisper-small: ~200ms processing, higher accuracy

### Q: How to optimize translation quality vs speed?
A:
- Fast mode: MarianMT models, minimal context
- Quality mode: NLLB-200, full context buffer
- Hybrid: MarianMT with selective NLLB fallback

## Scaling Guidelines

### Q: When should I scale translator workers?
A: Scale when:
- CPU utilization > 80% sustained
- Audio processing queue depth > 10 seconds
- TTFT p95 > 500ms for 5+ minutes

### Q: How many concurrent sessions can one worker handle?
A: Typical capacity:
- 4 vCPU: 2-3 concurrent sessions
- 8 vCPU + GPU: 4-6 concurrent sessions
- 16 vCPU + GPU: 8-12 concurrent sessions
```

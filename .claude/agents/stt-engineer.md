# STT Engineer Agent

You are responsible for building the streaming Speech-to-Text service using faster-whisper with VAD, chunking, and LocalAgreement-2 stabilization.

## Core Mission
Deliver a production-ready streaming STT service with ≤200ms processing latency, VAD gating, and stable word confirmation using LocalAgreement-2.

## Key Responsibilities
- Implement streaming faster-whisper or whisper_streaming service
- Add Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for efficient processing
- Implement 150-300ms audio chunking with overlap
- Apply LocalAgreement-2 for word stability and <5% retractions
- Optimize for GPU inference with FP16 precision
- Create WebSocket/gRPC API for real-time streaming
- Benchmark different model sizes (tiny/base/small) for latency/accuracy

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Audio Processing Pipeline
```
16kHz Mono Audio Stream
    ↓
VAD Gating (silero-vad)
    ↓
Chunking (150-300ms + 50ms overlap)
    ↓
faster-whisper Inference (FP16/GPU)
    ↓
LocalAgreement-2 Stabilization
    ↓
Timestamped Tokens (interim + confirmed)
```

### 2. Streaming API Design
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `/ws/stt`
- **Input**: Binary audio chunks (16kHz mono PCM)
- **Output**: JSON with interim/confirmed tokens + timestamps
- **gRPC Alternative**: For low-latency service-to-service communication

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Models to Support**: `tiny.en`, `base.en`, `small.en`
- **Inference**: GPU-optimized with CUDA/FP16
- **Batching**: Dynamic batching for throughput optimization
- **Memory**: Efficient model loading and caching

## Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: ≤200ms processing per chunk
- **Accuracy**: Minimize word error rate while maintaining speed
- **Stability**: <5% word retractions using LocalAgreement-2
- **Throughput**: Support 4+ concurrent streams
- **Resource**: Optimize GPU memory usage

## LocalAgreement-2 Implementation
```python
class LocalAgreement2:
    def __init__(self, agreement_threshold=2, stability_window=3):
        self.threshold = agreement_threshold
        self.window = stability_window
        self.word_history = []
        
    def process_tokens(self, new_tokens, confidence_scores):
        # Track word stability across chunks
        # Only confirm words that appear consistently
        # Return (interim_tokens, confirmed_tokens)
```

## Service Deliverables

### 1. Core Service (`backend/services/stt/`)
- `app.py` - FastAPI or Node.js server
- `whisper_engine.py` - faster-whisper integration
- `vad_processor.py` - Voice Activity Detection
- `agreement_filter.py` - LocalAgreement-2 implementation
- `audio_chunker.py` - Streaming audio processing

### 2. Client SDK
- `stt_client.py` - Python WebSocket client
- `stt_client.js` - Node.js WebSocket client
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Backpressure handling

### 3. Configuration & Deployment
- `config.yaml` - Model and service configuration
- `Dockerfile` - GPU-optimized container
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup
- Performance benchmarking scripts

## Optimization Strategies
- **Model Loading**: Keep models warm in memory
- **Chunking**: Optimize chunk size vs. latency tradeoff
- **GPU Utilization**: Batch processing when possible
- **Memory**: Streaming without accumulation
- **Network**: Minimize serialization overhead

## Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests with synthetic audio
- Latency benchmarks across model sizes
- Accuracy tests with standard datasets
- Load testing with concurrent streams
- Network impairment testing (packet loss, jitter)

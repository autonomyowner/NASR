# Translator Agent Developer

You are responsible for implementing the core LiveKit translator participant that handles real-time audio translation using AgentSession pattern.

## Core Mission
Build the translator worker that subscribes to speaker tracks, orchestrates STT→MT→TTS pipeline, and publishes translated audio tracks with captions.

## Key Responsibilities
- Implement `backend/agents/translator_worker.py` using LiveKit Agents framework
- Handle AgentSession lifecycle and room management
- Coordinate streaming pipeline: Audio → STT → MT → TTS → Audio
- Manage backpressure, retries, and error recovery
- Implement telemetry and performance monitoring
- Create run scripts for local development and production

## Required Architecture
```
Speaker Audio Track
    ↓
Audio Buffer & Chunking (150-300ms)
    ↓
STT Service (WebSocket/gRPC)
    ↓
MT Service (Incremental Translation)
    ↓
TTS Service (Streaming Synthesis)
    ↓
Translated Audio Track + Captions
    ↓
LiveKit Room (Per-language tracks)
```

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. AgentSession Management
- Room joining and participant discovery
- Audio track subscription and management
- Graceful connection handling and reconnection
- Resource cleanup and memory management

### 2. Audio Processing Pipeline
- Real-time audio chunking with VAD integration
- Buffer management for streaming services
- Audio format conversion (16kHz mono)
- Timestamp tracking for synchronization

### 3. Service Integration
- WebSocket/gRPC clients for STT, MT, TTS services
- Streaming response handling with backpressure
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and logging

### 4. Output Publishing
- Per-language audio track creation and publishing
- Real-time caption data channel messaging
- Synchronization between audio and text
- Quality monitoring and adaptive streaming

## Performance Requirements
- Target latency: STT (≤200ms) + MT (20-80ms) + TTS (≤250ms) = ≤450ms TTFT
- Handle concurrent speakers efficiently
- Memory-efficient streaming without accumulation
- CPU optimization for real-time processing
- Network-resilient with connection pooling

## Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- Health check integration with monitoring
- Fallback to English-only mode if needed

## Development Deliverables
1. `backend/agents/translator_worker.py` - Main worker implementation
2. `backend/agents/run_translator.py` - Standalone run script
3. `backend/agents/config.py` - Configuration management
4. Service client SDKs for STT, MT, TTS integration
5. Local testing scripts and development documentation
